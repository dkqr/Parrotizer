The solution and the folder are just basic things for visual stuido.

The Parrotizer(INDEPENDENT).exe file, is a standalone meaning it does not require .NET and will work on any computer, but is a much bigger file (it includes every windows dll which makes it as large as it is)
while the Parrotizer(NETDEPENDENT).exe file requires .NET but is much smaller and runs significantly faster

Parrotizer(NETDEPENDENT) is the recommended file to use for parrotizing!!
